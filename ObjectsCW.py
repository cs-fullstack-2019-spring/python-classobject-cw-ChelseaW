#     Afterwards, print the BMI (body mass index) of each Person.
#     If you donâ€™t know how to calculate BMI, look at the code I provided for you.
#
# Hint: BMI is (weight / (height * height)) x 703. Weight is in pounds and height is in inches.
#
# Extra:Put the three person objects in an array and use a loop to print out their BMIs.
